Unless otherwise noted, the commands output a graph of the tests, and the 
returned variable is a vector describing the number of tests classified 
correctly by the filter/SVM, by each training set size, in ascending order.

Q1: q1()
Q2: q2()
Q3:
  (All 7 training sets)
    Normalized    q3(false, true, false)
    Unnormalized  q3(false, false, false)
    Gaussian      q3(true, true, false)
  (Only 7th training set, outputs time and images)
    Gaussian      q3_single()
